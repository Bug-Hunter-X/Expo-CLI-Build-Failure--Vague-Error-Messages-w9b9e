This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an incorrect or outdated configuration, especially within the `package.json` and `app.json` files.  It's often related to mismatched dependencies or incorrect settings in these configuration files. The error message itself is vague, and doesn't provide much detail, making debugging challenging.  Typical symptoms include build failures without clear reasons or unexplained crashes during development.
