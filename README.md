# Expo CLI Build Failure: Vague Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with the Expo CLI: encountering vague error messages during the build process. The error messages often lack specifics, making debugging a time-consuming process. This example highlights the problem and provides a solution.

**Problem:**
The Expo CLI build process fails without clear indications of the underlying cause.  This often stems from inconsistencies in `package.json` (dependencies) and `app.json` (app configuration).

**Solution:**
Thorough review of project dependencies and configuration files.  Common issues include:
- Mismatched dependency versions.
- Incorrect or missing plugin configurations.
- Outdated Expo SDK versions.
- Conflicts between dependencies.

The solution provided focuses on dependency verification and configuration checks.  It's crucial to carefully examine the error logs for any hints, even if they are cryptic.
